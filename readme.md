# Identifying triangular arbitrages in the foreign exchange (forex) market

The forex market is a global, decentralized market whose trading volume reached "$6.6 trillion per day in April 2019." Given the size of the market, it may be possible for traders to profit from even small market inefficiencies.

For my Insight project, I am using forex exchange data to develop a dashbord that clarifies/detects triangular arbitrage opportunities so that traders can know what trades are potentially profitable.

To do this, I had to detect complex relationships among the many different data points.
